          <p>
            If you pass away today, what happens to your cryptocurrency? For traditional assets like real estate or bank accounts, the legal system takes over. Probate courts assign executors, banks freeze accounts, and eventually, the wealth is transferred to your heirs.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Cryptocurrency does not care about the legal system.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            If you hold your digital wealth in a self-custodial wallet—whether it's a Ledger, Trezor, MetaMask, or Trust Wallet—the blockchain enforces one absolute rule: <em>Not your keys, not your coins.</em>
          </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-0 mb-4">The Tragic Reality of Lost Crypto</h3>
            <p className="mb-0">
              According to blockchain analytics firms, roughly 20% of all Bitcoin currently in existence is lost forever. That equates to roughly <strong>$189 billion</strong>. While some of this is due to early miners throwing away hard drives, a rapidly growing percentage is due to unexpected deaths where the owner had no crypto inheritance plan.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h2>The Hardware Wallet Dilemma</h2>
          <p>
            Many crypto investors mistakenly believe that keeping their hardware wallet in a physical safe is enough. But consider this from your spouse or child's perspective:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Do they know the safe exists?</li>
            <li>Do they know the PIN to the hardware device?</li>
            <li>If the device breaks, do they know what a "seed phrase" is?</li>
            <li>Do they know how to restore a wallet using that seed phrase?</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            If the answer to any of these is "no," your crypto is as good as gone.
          </p>

          <h2>Centralized Exchanges (Coinbase, Binance, Kraken)</h2>
          <p>
            If your funds are on a centralized exchange, the process is slightly different but equally stressful. Because exchanges are regulated financial entities, they have procedures for deceased users.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, your family must first <strong>know the account exists</strong>. If you used an obscure exchange or a DeFi platform, no one will ever know to look there. Secondly, recovering funds from an exchange post-mortem requires death certificates, legal probate documents, and often months of back-and-forth with customer support.
          </p>

          <h2>The Solution: A Zero-Knowledge Digital Legacy Vault</h2>
          <p>
            Writing your seed phrase on a piece of paper and handing it to a lawyer is a terrible idea. It creates a massive security vulnerability while you are alive.
          </p>
          <p>
            The modern, secure solution is a <strong>Zero-Knowledge Digital Vault</strong> like <Link to="/" className="text-primary hover:underline">Transfer Legacy</Link>.
          </p>

          <h3>How Transfer Legacy Protects You</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Zero-Knowledge Architecture:</strong> Your seed phrases and passwords are encrypted locally. No one at Transfer Legacy can read them.</li>
            <li><strong>Fragmented Guardian Protocol:</strong> You don't trust just one person. You split the "unlock key" among several trusted guardians (e.g., your spouse, best friend, and attorney).</li>
            <li><strong>Dead Man's Switch:</strong> The vault is only unlocked when a verified event occurs—either through a timed check-in failure or verification by your guardians.</li>
            <li><strong>AI Heir Guidance:</strong> Your family receives plain-English, step-by-step instructions on how to access the funds, shielding them from the technical complexity of the blockchain.</li>
          </ul>
