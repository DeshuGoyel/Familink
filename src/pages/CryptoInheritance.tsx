        <h2>The $189 Billion Problem: What Happens to Crypto When You Die?</h2>
        <p>
          Unlike a traditional bank account, cryptocurrency operates on cryptographic mathematical proofs rather than human trust. If you hold Bitcoin, Ethereum, or any digital asset in a self-custodial wallet (like a Ledger, Trezor, or MetaMask), <strong>you are your own bank</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what happens when the bank dies? 
        </p>
        <div className="bg-danger/10 border border-danger/20 rounded-xl p-6 my-8 text-danger-foreground">
          <h4 className="flex items-center gap-2 text-danger mt-0 mb-2"><AlertTriangle /> Real-World Consequence</h4>
          <p className="mb-0">In 2021, a crypto investor tragically passed away in an accident. He held over $4 million in Bitcoin on a hardware wallet. His widow knew the wallet existed but didn't have the 24-word seed phrase. Despite hiring cybersecurity experts, the funds remain locked on the blockchain forever. His family lost everything.</p>
        </div>
        <p>
          This is not an isolated incident. Chainalysis estimates that up to 20% of all Bitcoin ever mined—worth over $189 billion—is lost forever. A massive portion of this is due to sudden death without a <strong>crypto inheritance</strong> plan.
        </p>

        <h2>Why Traditional Wills Fail Digital Assets</h2>
        <p>
          You might think, "I have a will, my lawyer will handle it." Unfortunately, traditional estate planning is entirely unequipped for Web3 and digital assets.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Lawyers aren't cryptographers:</strong> Handing a lawyer your seed phrase on a piece of paper is a massive security risk. If their office is burglarized or their files are hacked, your funds are instantly stolen while you are still alive.</li>
          <li><strong>Probate is public:</strong> In many jurisdictions, a probated will becomes public record. Do you want the world to know you have $500,000 in Bitcoin and exactly how to access it?</li>
          <li><strong>Speed of execution:</strong> Crypto markets are highly volatile. Probate can take months or years. Your heirs need immediate, secure access.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Anatomy of a Digital Will for Cryptocurrency</h2>
        <p>
          A comprehensive digital will for your cryptocurrency requires a zero-trust, mathematically enforced protocol. This is exactly what <strong>Transfer Legacy</strong> provides. A proper plan must cover:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Asset Inventory:</strong> A secure mapping of where your assets are (Hardware wallets, Coinbase, Binance, DeFi smart contracts).</li>
          <li><strong>Credential Transfer:</strong> The automated, encrypted handover of Passwords, Seed Phrases, and Private Keys.</li>
          <li><strong>2FA and Security Keys:</strong> Instructions and access to your YubiKey, Google Authenticator, or backup codes.</li>
          <li><strong>Legal Directives:</strong> A Letter of Instruction to your heirs and executors.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>How Transfer Legacy Solves Crypto Inheritance</h2>
        <p>
          Transfer Legacy was built on first-principles thinking to solve the single point of failure in digital inheritance. We use <strong>Zero-Knowledge Encryption</strong> and a <strong>Multi-Guardian Protocol</strong>.
        </p>
        
        <h3>1. Zero-Knowledge Vault</h3>
        <p>
          When you enter your seed phrase or passwords into Transfer Legacy, the data is encrypted <em>locally on your device</em> before it is ever transmitted to our servers. We mathematically cannot read your data. If our servers are ever breached, the attackers get nothing but randomized ciphertext.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Shamir's Secret Sharing (The Guardian Protocol)</h3>
        <p>
          Instead of giving one person the "master key" to your vault, Transfer Legacy splits the key into fragments using an advanced cryptographic algorithm called Shamir's Secret Sharing. You distribute these fragments to trusted "Guardians" (e.g., your spouse, your sibling, and your lawyer). 
        </p>
        <p>
          No single Guardian can access your vault. But if you pass away, a predefined threshold of Guardians (e.g., 2 out of 3) must verify your passing. Only then do the fragments recombine, unlocking the vault for your designated heirs.
        </p>

        <h2>Global Legal Context</h2>
        <p>
          The legal landscape for <strong>crypto estate planning</strong> is rapidly evolving. Transfer Legacy is built to assist with compliance globally:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>USA:</strong> Under RUFADAA (Revised Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act), adopted in 47 states, executors have the legal right to access digital accounts if explicitly granted.</li>
          <li><strong>India:</strong> The October 2025 Madras High Court ruling established that cryptocurrency is recognized as property and is fully inheritable under the Succession Act.</li>
          <li><strong>UAE:</strong> The DIFC Digital Assets Law explicitly recognizes digital assets as property, providing a robust framework for estate planning.</li>
          <li><strong>UK:</strong> The Law Commission recently recognized crypto as a distinct category of personal property.</li>
        </ul>
